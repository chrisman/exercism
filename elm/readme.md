# Elm

whoo-whee, functional programming

1. Hello World - Had to learn what a `maybe` and a `just` was. Tests and error msgs were helpful.

2. bob - neat-o cases and tuples.

3. leap - `let` .. `in`. dat's cool.

4. raindrops - _plingplangplong._ wanted to make this resursive until i realized they didn't want repeated syllables.

5. pangram - second iteration = much more readable. learned `|>` piping. :thumbsup: next I'll have to consider `<<` composition
